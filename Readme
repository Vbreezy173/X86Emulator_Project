This program is a X86 8/16-bit emulator written in C++. It features some basic architeaure from the x86 proccersor. The program implements the following features-
1. General-Purpose Registers (GPR)
2. Memory
3. Instruction Pointer (IP regester)
The program takes a x86 assembly code file compiled to machine code (.com) and exuctues the commands.
The program can execuate the following X86 instructions-
1.)XCHG
2.)ADD
3.)SUB
4.)MOV
5.)INC
6.)DEC
7.)INT 21h
Each instruction moves data to and from the registers and depending on the data in the register certain operation can be done. An example is displaying "Hello World".

I have provided 3 .com files as examples that can be used in this program to be run.
